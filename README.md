# BattleGame

This is an experiment in learning game design and development. 

I am using the Phaser game engine to develop a "Choose your own adventure" style game with Pok√©mon style turn-based battles.

Currently it will be a post-apocalyptic adventure in figuring out why the apocalypse happened, and your role in causing it. I think the artwork will be steam-punk inspired... if I can find an artist that is, lol
